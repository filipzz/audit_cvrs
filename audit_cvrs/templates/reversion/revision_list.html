   <h1>Pilot Risk-Limiting Audit, Adams County Colorado, 2015-11-24</h1>
   <h2>{% block title %} Record of manual audit of selected CVRs via audit_cvrs software {% endblock %}</h2>
    <p>Each row shows the time when the ballot was manually inspected, who entered the data, the ballot (selection sequence number, Cast Vote Record (CVR) number, batch number, and sequence within the batch), the ballot status, the discrepancy for the margin of victory, and notes.</p>
    <p>Ballot "Status" values are either "Selected" or "Completed"</p>
    <p>"Discrepancy" is "0" if the manual inspection of the paper ballot agrees with the reported CVR interpretation.  A discrepancy of "1" indicates a 1-vote <i>overstatement</i> of the margin of victory.  For example, if the voting system declared a victory for the "Yes" side of a ballot measure, and it recorded an undervote in a given CVR, but the human interpretation of the associated paper ballot showed a "No" vote, that would be a 1-vote overstatement of the margin.  If enough ballots have overstatements, the declared outcome could be wrong.  If the human interpretation of the ballot indicates an extra vote for the declared winner, that would be a one-vote understatement of the margin, which would actually increase the evidence that the declared winner won.  That could happen if a ballot recorded as an undervote was determined to be a vote for the declared winner, or if a ballot recorded as a vote for the loser was determined to be an undervote.</p>
    <p>A two-vote overstatement of the margin of victory can also happen, e.g. if a ballot that the system recorded as a vote for the declared winner is seen to be a vote for the loser instead.  The value "None" for the discrepancy means that the manual interpretation of the paper ballot has not yet happened.</p>
