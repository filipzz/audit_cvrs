<h1>Audit CVRs Data Site</h1>

<p>This site is powered by the audit_cvrs application, which is associated with the
<a href="http://neal.mcburnett.org/electionaudits/">
 ElectionAudits software</a>,
which provides software and documentation in support of
the <a href="http://electionaudits.org/principles">
 Principles and Best Practices for Post-Election Audits</a>
and the other work of <a href="http://electionaudits.org/">
 ElectionAudits.org</a>,
 the nation's clearinghouse for election audit information.
</p>
<p>The software is open source, still in very active
"alpha" development
<!--
and can be followed at its Launchpad.net site:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://launchpad.net/electionaudits">https://launchpad.net/electionaudits</a>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the place to get the source code, file bugs,
make contributions, learn about election auditing, etc.

<h2>Audit steps</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Run the election, save Cast Vote Records (CVRs), and create a manifest of how many ballots are in each batch</li>
 <li>Publish the CVRs (or a commitment to them) for the general public.</li>
 <li>Set the audit up by using <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Vote/auditTools.htm">Tools for Comparison Risk-Limiting Election Audits</a> and follow the directions to:
   <ol>
     <li>Create a manifest showing which ballots are in which batches</li>
     <li>Have various stakeholders roll dice to generate a verifiably random seed to determine which ballots are audited</li>
     <li>Enter the contest parameters</li>
     <li>Draw a random sample of ballots to be audited</li>
     <li>Look up ballots in the manifest to create the "Sorted lookup table"</li>
 </ol>
 <li>Copy and paste the "Sorted lookup table" it provides into a file, and read it in to this tool using the "./manage.py parse file" command from the command line.</li>
 <li>Visit the list of selected CVRs via this link (in a separate browser tab if you like): <a href="admin/audit_cvrs/cvr/">CVR</a>.  You will need to log in the admin account you set up via manage.py.  It will show the selected CVRs for the audit.</li>
 <li>Run through the given CVRs.  Click each one:
  <ol>
    <li>Assign it each for auditing, by setting the status to "assigned".</li>
    <li>Retrieve the proper ballot, write down the manual interpretation of the ballot, and compare the manual interpretation with the machine interpretation.</li>
    <li>Set the Discrepancy field to "Interpretations match" or to the proper discrepancy value, and set the status to "Completed".</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
