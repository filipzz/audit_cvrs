<h1>Audit CVRs Data Site</h1>

<p>This site is powered by the audit_cvrs application, which is associated with the
<a href="http://neal.mcburnett.org/electionaudits/">
 ElectionAudits software</a>,
which provides software and documentation in support of
the <a href="http://electionaudits.org/principles">
 Principles and Best Practices for Post-Election Audits</a>
and the other work of <a href="http://electionaudits.org/">
 ElectionAudits.org</a>,
 the nation's clearinghouse for election audit information.
</p>
<p>The software is open source, still in very active
"alpha" development
<!--
and can be followed at its Launchpad.net site:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://launchpad.net/electionaudits">https://launchpad.net/electionaudits</a>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the place to get the source code, file bugs,
make contributions, learn about election auditing, etc.
-->
</p>

<p>
Set the audit up by using <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Vote/auditTools.htm">Tools for Comparison Risk-Limiting Election Audits</a> to enter the contest parameters and manifest, enter the random seed, and thus select the ballots to be audited.
Copy and paste the "Sorted lookup table" into a file and read it in to this tool using the manage.py parse command from the command line.
</p>
<p>
Next, log in to the admin account you set up, starting with the <a href="admin/audit_cvrs/cvr/">CVR</a> data to run the audit.
Choose CVRs to assign for auditing, set the status to "assigned", retrieve the proper ballot, record the manual interpretation of the ballot, compare the manual interpretation with the machine interpretation, set the status to "Completed", and set the Discrepancy field to "Interpretations match" or to the proper discrepancy value.
